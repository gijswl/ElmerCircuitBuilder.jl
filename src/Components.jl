Represents a massive 2D or 3D coil named `name` connected between two circuit `nodes`.
The component is associated with the Component (`component_id`) section in the SIF and the physical bodies in `master_bodies`.

Sector represents the integer associated with Symmetry Coefficient under Elmer's component. 
By default the value is 1, describing the full dimention of the circuit. 
Change the value accordingly depending on the symmetry of the problem at hand. 
For example if you're modeling half of the coil, then the value of sector is 0.5.

If the 3D coil is not `closed`, two terminal `boundaries` must be defined.
